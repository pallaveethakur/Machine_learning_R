#Perform clustering 
#(Both hierarchical and K means clustering) for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters.
#Data Description:

#The file EastWestAirlinescontains information on passengers who belong to an 
#airline√¢???Ts frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include 
#information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent
#miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers 
#that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different 
#segments for different types of mileage offers

#ID --Unique ID

#Balance--Number of miles eligible for award travel

#Qual_mile--Number of miles counted as qualifying for Topflight status

#cc1_miles -- Number of miles earned with freq. flyer credit card in the past 12 months:
#cc2_miles -- Number of miles earned with Rewards credit card in the past 12 months:
#cc3_miles -- Number of miles earned with Small Business credit card in the past 12 months:

#1 = under 5,000
#2 = 5,000 - 10,000
#3 = 10,001 - 25,000
#4 = 25,001 - 50,000
#5 = over 50,000

#Bonus_miles--Number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

#Bonus_trans--Number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

#Flight_miles_12mo--Number of flight miles in the past 12 months

#Flight_trans_12--Number of flight transactions in the past 12 months

#Days_since_enrolled--Number of days since enrolled in flier program

#Award--whether that person had award f
